summary: Radare2 reverse engineering framework and tool
description: |
  Radare2 (also known as r2) is a complete framework for reverse-engineering 
  and analyzing binaries; composed of a set of small utilities 
  that can be used together or independently from the command line. 
  Built around a disassembler for computer software which generates 
  assembly language source code from machine-executable code, 
  it supports a variety of executable formats for different processors 
  and operating systems.
  . 
  This is an unofficial snap package of radare2. Very soon 
  there will be an official package at https://snapcraft.io/radare2
  When an official snap is ready, this package will get unlisted.

grade: stable # must be 'stable' to release into candidate/stable channels
